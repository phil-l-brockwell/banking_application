# Definition of Customer Account Class
# This is the class that all customer accounts will inherit from.
# It has been implemented so that the master account will not have certain features, such as overdraft
class CustomerAccount < BaseAccount
  # inherits from base account

  # defines readable attributes. these attributes can now be read outside of the object.
  # equivalent to creating a getter method in java or other languages
  # so account.interest_rate will return 0.1

    # used to store the main holder of the account

    # sets id to the id that was equal to the id that was passed to initialize
    # this hash will be used to store secondary holders on the account
    @holders       = {}
    # sets holders equal to an empty hash object, similar to a java hash map
    @interest_rate = 0.1
    # sets interest rate equal to 0.1, this will be used for calculating interest
    @daily_limit   = LIMIT
    # sets daily limit equal to the limit constant
    @overdraft_on  = false
    # overdraft defaults to off
    @overdraft     = 0.00

  # overrides withdrawal method defined in base account to incorporate error checking
  # the account will be responsible for tracking its own own limit, balance
  # and raising exceptions if these rules are breached
  # therefore the accounts main responsiblity is to ensure its integrity as an account

    fail OverLimit unless limit_allow? amount
    # by using conditional returns it eliminates the need for complex nested if/else/elsif statements
    # making the code more readable and simpler
    # if neither of the exceptions are raised the method will execute the following lines
    @balance -= amount
    # removes the amount from the daily limit
    @daily_limit -= amount
    # creates a transaction and adds it to the transaction array
